**Ether** is an open-source pixel art color converter that lets you transform images (in very easy way) according to a chosen color palette. Whether you want your art to feel like it belongs on a Sega Master System, SNES, or your own custom palette, Ether makes it happen with accurate color mapping.

## âœ¨ Features
- Convert any image to match a selected palette
- Support for custom color palettes (e.g., Sega Genesis)
- Batch mode, is possible to convert more than one image with the same palette
- Designed for pixel art, but would work with any raster image
- Open source under the BSD 2-Clause license
